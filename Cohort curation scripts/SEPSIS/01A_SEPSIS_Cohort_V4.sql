/*
Filename:
01A_SEPSIS_Cohort_V4.sql

Purpose:
This script creates a cohort of patients for the SEPSIS registry.
The patient list is saved in the cohort table, along with other useful data elements.

Description:
This SQL script creates a cohort of hospitalized patients with sepsis
based on specific criteria. The script performs several steps to identify and filter
the patients before finally creating the cohort table. The script sets the context to
use a specific database, but the schema name is meant to be provided
by the user.

Dependencies:
None
