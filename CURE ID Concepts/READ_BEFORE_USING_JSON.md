*Please note that the .json file maintained in ATLAS does not contain 5 custom concepts assigned to oxygen devices that are not covered by the OMOP Vocabularies. 
<br/><br/>
If you are generating a cohort using ATLAS or the json file, you will need to add these concepts manually. These are listed in the "custom_concepts.csv" file.
