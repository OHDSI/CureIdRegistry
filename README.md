CureIdRegistry

The Cure Id Registry is a clinical registry leveraging OMOP and EHR automation.  CURE ID is a collaboration between the FDA and the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).

This Github repository is the migrated documentation from the FDA Cure ID project. This move was motivated by the inconsistencies of the current storage method, in Microsoft Teams. This repository takes the Concept list from the Cure-ID Registry group, within the Health Special Interests Teams group, and combines it with the Cohort Creation scripts from the Cure**S** ID Registry group, also within the same Teams environment.
